# Hello, I'm Mateus FalcÃ£o ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a mechanical engineering student at University of Campinas (UNICAMP) who is passionate about working with people, tackling complex problems and constantly learning new things with the belief that diversity and cross-disciplinary collaboration are key to driving innovation and making a positive impact in the world.
### I have worked with RPA and data engineering for 1 year and 3 months at Visagio, a technology consulting firm from Rio de Janeiro. There I learn about hard skills (i.e relational databases, pipelines implementation, data extraction and data analysis) and soft skills (i.e how to speak properly with project leaderships, be more organized and deal with errors). Moreover, I was part of the team responsible for:
### - Automate contract distribution processes in a B2B chain with Python.
### - Data migration and script migration from the SAP ECC platform to SAP S/4HANA, enabling real-time data processing.
### - Implementation and restructuring of pipelines designed for extracting multimodal data from online platforms, enabling the analysis of cost, expenditure, and electricity generation.
### - Data extraction and maturation of sales and inventory data for the client company.
### - Data analysis for the client company's sales and inventory data.

### I taken part at Unicamp E-racing, a formula SAE team from Unicamp, on the first autonomous car division in Latin America. There I worked in SLAM (Simoultaneus Localization and Mapping), in which together with other teammates we implemented a location and map creation system based on the FASTSLAM algorithm.

### Theremore, I was a voluntary teacher at EDUCAVID, a program wich I teach physics for high school students for the college entrance exam.

### Know-how: Excel, Python, SQL, relational database, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory, Webhook, API REST, Web scraping, Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Warehouse, PowerBI, Java, ETL, Postman, SAP ECC, SAP S/4HANA, Bayesian filter, Kalman filter, Extended Kalman filter, Particle filter, homogeneous coordinates, FASTSLAM.
